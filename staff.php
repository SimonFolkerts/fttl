                    <h3>Cessna Turbo Stationair</h3>
                    <p>The Cessna 205, 206, and 207, known variously as the Super Skywagon, Skywagon, Stationair, 
                        and Super Skylane are a family of single-engined, general aviation aircraft with fixed 
                        landing gear, used in commercial air service and also for personal use. The family was 
                        originally developed from the popular retractable-gear Cessna 210 and is produced by 
                        Cessna. The line's combination of a powerful engine, rugged construction and a large 
                        cabin has made these aircraft popular bush planes. Cessna describes the 206 as "the 
                        sport-utility vehicle of the air." </p>

                    <h3>Cessna 172 Skyhawk</h3>
                    <p>The Cessna 172 Skyhawk is a four-seat, single-engine, high wing, fixed-wing aircraft 
                        made by the Cessna Aircraft Company. First flown in 1955, more Cessna 172s have been 
                        built than any other aircraft. Measured by its longevity and popularity, the Cessna 
                        172 is the most successful aircraft in history. Cessna delivered the first production
                        models in 1956. As of 2015, Cessna, and its partners, had built more than 43,000.</p>

                    <p>The Cessna 208 Caravan is a single-engined turboprop, fixed-tricycle landing gear, 
                        short-haul regional airliner and utility aircraft that is built in the United States 
                        by Cessna. This version is an amphibious variant: a 208 Caravan with Wipaire 8000 
                        floats in place of the landing gear, for water landings or land operations.</p>

                    <h3>DG1001 Sailplane</h3>
                    <p>The DG Flugzeugbau DG-1000 is a glider of the Two Seater Class built by DG Flugzeugbau. 
                        It first flew in July 2000 at Speyer in Germany. There are four models, with 18- and 
                        20-metre wings of HQK-51 profile. The 1001 replaced the DG-505 in production. With an 
                        18-metre span it is fully certified for aerobatics (and +7/-5 Gs); with a 20-metre 
                        span it is certified for limited aerobatics (and +5/-2.65 Gs). The retractable engine 
                        (DG1000T) is mounted on a pylon aft of the double cockpit. There is a reduction gear 
                        (2:3 to 1.0) between the engine and the two-blade carbon-fibre composite propeller. 
                        The propeller was designed and is produced by the DG factory.</p>

                    <h3>Bell 206 Jetranger</h3>
                    <p>The Bell 206 is a family of two-bladed, single- or twin-engined helicopters, 
                        manufactured by Bell Helicopter at its Mirabel, Quebec plant. Originally 
                        developed as the Bell YOH-4 for the United States Army's Light Observation 
                        Helicopter program, it was not selected by the Army. Bell redesigned the 
                        airframe and successfully marketed the aircraft commercially as the five-place 
                        Bell 206A JetRanger.</p>

                    <p>The Extra 200 (Type EA-200) is a two-seat, tandem arrangement, low-wing aerobatic 
                        monoplane with conventional (taildragger) landing gear fully capable of Unlimited 
                        category competition, built by Extra Flugzeugbau. Designed by Walter Extra, it was 
                        introduced to the United States market in 1996. The Extra 200 is a little smaller 
                        than the Extra 300, and is powered by a 200 hp (149 kW) rather than the Extra 300's 
                        300 hp (224 kW) Lycoming engine making it a great choice for those on a restricted 
                        budget. It offers the flying characteristics of the EA-300, is capable of all unlimited 
                        maneuvers, and makes a great all-round training/sports aerobatic aircraft.</p>

                        <p>Hans has flown almost everything there is to fly. He first took the controls of a 
                            small plane at 12 years old, and flew solo when he was 14. After a few years flying 
                            “anything, anywhere” he settled into a series of test pilot jobs, but left that 
                            because he prefers company when he’s in the air. Hans doesn’t actually own his 
                            own plane right now , unless you count the microlight, but you will find him in 
                            the pilot’s seat of any of our aircraft. When he’s not skiing, tramping, climbing, 
                            hang gliding, or performing with his backup band at a local hotel.</p>
